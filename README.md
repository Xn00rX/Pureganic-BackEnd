# Set Up Pureganic Front End

These are the steps to set up the Pureganic Front End on your local machine.

1. **Fork and Clone:**
   - Start by forking the front-end repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/Pureganic-FrontEnd).
   - Open Git Bash or your preferred terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
   - Clone the front-end repository using the following command:

     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pureganic-FrontEnd.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to Cloned Folder:**
   - Change your working directory to the cloned project folder:

     ```shell
     cd Pureganic-FrontEnd
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Use npm to install project dependencies. The `--force` flag can be used to ensure all packages are reinstalled if needed:

     ```shell
     npm install --force
     ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   - Start the development server to run the front-end application:

     ```shell
     npm run dev
     ```

5. **Resolve Binding Problems:**
   - If you encounter any binding problems, you can try installing the `@swc/cli` and `@swc/core` as development dependencies:

     ```shell
     npm i -D @swc/cli @swc/core
     ```

6. **Ensure the Back End Is Running:**
   - Make sure that the back end of your application is running. You can follow the instructions provided on your [Pureganic-BackEnd GitHub repository](https://github.com/Xn00rX/Pureganic-BackEnd) for setting up and running the back end.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up the Pureganic Front End and run it for development. Please ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before proceeding.and is runnying on localhost:4000
